        "#Topic Descriptions\n",
        "Topic 1: good backpacks for school\n",
        "Topic 10: reviews in Spanish\n",
        "Topic 11: cute clothes for children and babies\n",
        "Topic 14: comfortable board shorts good for swimming and other activities\n",
        "Topic 15: warm, comfortable, and soft hoodies\n",
        "Topic 17: form-fitting and sturdy rash guards for swimming and surfing\n",
        "Topic 20: shirts fit too large, buy a size smaller \n",
        "Topic 21: warm jackets for adults and children, prices a little high for Quiksilver Baby Boys' Buddy Jacket\n",
        "Topic 23: people highly recommend and trust Quiksilver to make t-shirts with cool designs and colors like B00B2I789K Quiksilver Sultan Shirt\n",
        "Topic 24: Some think the sandals are comfortable with nice colors, but others think they are sized a little small with high arches \n",
        "Topic 28: True-to-size shoes that take a while to wear in. Some say they run large, and some say they run small. B006ZP4K1Y Quiksilver shoe\n",
        "Topic 29: Shipping costs are too high, and shirts came with defects like B005HGT65M – Men’s Scrappy T-Shirt\n",
        "Topic 33: Sturdy, leather wallets with a coin pocket and zippers for security that people like B008EMFYXY Quiksilver Men’s Acute Wallet\n",
        "#Preprocessing Steps\n",
        "To preprocess the Amazon data, I first added the text from the reviews into a corpus. I then used tmtoolkit.preprocess to preprocess the data. I made all the words lowercase and removed the common tokens by a threshold of 0.8. I reduced the vocabulary size from 8066 tokens to 4943 tokens. I then saved the larger and smaller vocabularies as vocab_bg and vocab_sm, I also saved matrices of both for my next step of topic modeling.\n",
        "#Model Steps\n",
        "I used tmtoolkit[‘lda’] to create topic models of my data. I first picked the number of topics as 16 and computed the topics. I then evaluated my topic model and found 45 is the ideal number of topics in order to minimize and maximize. I next edited my number of topics and ran my topic model again. After that, I classified each review into the different topics.\n",
        "Marketing & Product Insights\n",
        "#Attributes that people like about our products\n",
        "People like the comfort, colors, designs, and functionality of the clothes, shoes, wallets, and backpacks. People like the sun-proof and durable rash guards. They also like the multifunctional board shorts. Children think Quiksilver is a cool brand for clothes and backpacks.\n",
        "#Attributes that people dislike about our products\n",
        "People dislike that the shirts run large. They dislike that the shoes run either large or small. They dislike when prices are too high or their products are delivered with defects. Some also complain about the shoes taking time to wear in.\n",
        "#Purchase Occasions\n",
        "People buy Quiksilver rash guards and board shorts when they are going to the beach to surf or swim. People buy jackets for their children or themselves when it is about to be winter or for Christmas season. People buy flip flops for the beach or everyday wear. People also buy Quiksilver products as gifts.\n",
        "#Product Development/Improvement Ideas\n",
        "Quiksilver could make their shoe and t-shirt sizing more predictable. Quiksilver should make the shoes more comfortable right after purchase.\n",
        "#Pricing Suggestions\n",
        "Quiksilver could consider looking at its competitors’ pricing to insure its prices are set well because some customers think their prices are too high.\n",
        "#What’s Not in the Data\n",
        "I was surprised skate, skateboard was not a topic as many skateboarders wear Quiksilver clothes and shoes in California if they do or do not surf.\n",
        "#Diving Further into the Data\n",
        "I think Quiksilver should make the shoes immediately comfortable with no time to wear in, and the flip flops should have extra sturdy straps to not break after a day or two. Quiksilver should make the sizing more consistent. Quiksilver should also insure its pricing is competitive. Quiksilver should check all products before shipment for defects."

The friend who bought told me and showed me the Sandals after 2 weeks of use, with the contact of water they started to  detached from the sole and having an old appareance, I was very embarrassed and gave him the money back. I just wanted to leave this message in order to prevent other buyers when there are Sandals or Shoes on \"Sale\". I repeat, I\\'m not demeriting any brand, I only aware that sometimes those items keep too much time in Stocked in the warehouse so the glue start to crystallize. The result is when you wear it they start to rip of. Maybe much of you had read something about this before but I though it was worth to state it. I do not have the opportunity to send them back because I live in COLOMBIA, it would be insane spend too much money & Time in resending the item to USA and asking for a change or refund.

We got it in the mail the other day, and my husband really likes it. The large is the perfect size,and it has a very nice warm fleece lining. Even though we live in Northern Florida and don't necessarily need heavy jackets, this jacket will be perfect for visiting up north this Christmas. The only down side is that the fabric looks like it will catch and hold any kind of dust or lint, so make sure that you have a lint roller on hand.\",\n",

I don't think I would pay the 20+ dollars they usually go for because the front strap between the Big toe and the other toes seems to wear down quickly for me and would get expensive to keep buying them at full price to replace them.

I loved how comfy they were, and how they fit my foot perfectly, so I hopped online and ordered myself a pair. When I told my friend that I ordered them he let me know that I had made a mistake, as the dye in the straps constantly stain his feet black. I decided to give them a shot anyway, as they were a newer and different pair than his, and because my only other pair of sandals were in really bad shape. At first, the sandals didn't do anything to my feet, but that all changed on my first visit to the beach. When I got home I noticed big black spots on my feet that my girlfriend thought were bruises. They were hideous and hard to scrub off. It's been 4 months now and they still dye my feet really bad when they get wet. They will even leave small black marks when I wear them and keep them dry. There are too many comfortable sandals out there that don't stain your skin to waste your money on these. How the other reviewers on Amazon didn't notice this is beyond me... maybe they all live in Nevada. I'm just going to stop being cheap and shell out the $40+ for a nice pair of Rainbows.\",\n",

              "  'reviewText': \"This is the fourth pair of these flip flops I've owned now.  Note, it is from repeatedly losing them, never from them breaking.To put it simply, These are my absolute favourite flip flops.  I can't deal with cheap old navy ones, because the plastic strap gives me blisters.  These ones, however, are extremely comfortable, with a cloth strap between the toes.  The part of the strap that actually goes over your feet is suede, and is as comfortable as the rest of the sandal.What's most important to me, however, is the sole of the sandal.  With many high end sandals, you have a firm but, in my opinion, uncomfortable surface.  With these ones however, the sole is made of a foam, so it is extremely comfortable from the beginning, and only gets better as you wear it in.  As I mentioned previously, I've never had any issue with these breaking, and every pair I've had has lasted me until I lost them.The only con that I can think of is that when I had a black pair, the suede would leave a black mark on my foot if they got wet.  However, this only happened a few times, and then that wore out.  It did not affect its comfort or look though.  In conclusion:Pros:+ Most comfortable pair of flip flops I've ever had+ High quality, won't break or wear out on you+ As far as upper end flip flops go, they're pretty cheapCons:- Suede may leave marks on your feet the first few times they get wet.  Only ever had this issue with the black pair though, and I've also owned both brown and tan pairs.Ultimately, I will continue to return to these flip flops each time I need a new pair, as they are comfortable, high quality, and simple but nice looking.\",\n",

These are also not all rubber so they don't weigh a ton like Chacaos, keens, etc, which I also own.-You don't slide on the top of the foam when it gets wet like all other foam sandals bc it has texture.The combination of a little rubber, light/and textured foam, and leather strap makes these things light, durable, and they last over 2 years with wearing them almost everyday. I wore them so much I got more because I was so impressed. I now own 4 pairs in different colors of these. Also the straps never break; and I jump off the boat, walk around in the surf, all kinds of Florida living stuff. Even suction while walking through muddy areas near mangroves in Tampa Bay doesn't break the straps if you forget to take them off before you jump in. Trust a Floridian, these are the best all around. Keen full foot sandals do work better in the mud if you want a mud walking sandal for fishing.I have worn these hiking, traveling around the world, they just hold up.\",\n",

He says they keep him cool and dog hair does not stick to them.  Also, they don't come with a bunch of inflated pockets like most mens cargo shorts.  They do seem to be a little tight around the hips, but they fit in the waist.

An elastic is just not going to hold your shorts in place in a wipe out, and netting... Well, I don't even know what that is for.These fit exactly as sized. They look big first, but fit well. They are well made and feel good in the water. The only complaint I have is that the Velcro in the pocket has a gap in the middle. The gap looks like it is too small for a key to come out but I would like to have no doubt. When you go out surfing you like to leave everything in the car and just carry a key. That pocket needs to be bulletproof. So I'll add the piece that is missing. Its not a big deal. Other than that these shorts are awesome. The price is very low for shorts of this quality.\",\n",

The bag looks good but you can tell its a more laid back, younger person's bag as opposed to fine leather brief case, which kinda is the point, hence why it's so inexpensive. The only white on the bag, the quicksilver lettering, isn't too pronounced and doesn't detract from the subtle black  coloring of the bag.In terms of utility, lotta space inside. I carry my work folder, extra papers, a leisure book for the train, mp3 player, bulky headphones, water bottle, relatively large microwaveable glass lunch container, and spare change, pens, note paper, even keys/wallet/phone.My main gripe with the bag is there are no external pockets. It is handy to have at least a water bottle pocket on the side, let alone a small zipper compartment for anything you need quick access to. Alas, you are forced to store everything inside. This leads me to my next point, which is the bag's velcro and snap-buckle fasteners secure the contents of the bag very well. Plenty of different size compartments w/ both zipper and velcro allow you to store your things in a variety of ways and places.Given how light the bag is, how, even when stuffed, it never feels too heavy, the comfy shoulder strap, and low price, this bag is a great buy.\",\n",

This second pair does not disappoint as for fit and comfort.  If I get the same wear as with the first set, I'll be one happy flip-flopper (and how's that for a non-politician?).  The first pair lasted me a little over a year, and that was with wearing them every day and walking my dog many miles on the hard concrete sidewalks of Miami.  I could still be wearing the first pair, but the hard rubber part of the sole wore through at the heel and I was getting into the soft foam pretty fast.  I still could have probably gotten a couple of more months out of them, but my wife has a hard fast rule of one thing in, one thing out, so out they went.  I normally wear a size 12 shoe, but I like my flip-flops to extend out beyond my foot just a tad all the way around, so I ordered size 13.  Perfect!!  Try'em, you'll like'em.  The price is right, and the comfort is unparalleled.\",\n",

He likes plain or simple board shorts, without crazy logos or colors on them, and really likes white ones.  When I found these, I knew he would like them.  He got so many compliments on our vacation and people asking where he got these board shorts.The fabric is a high quality, durable material, and though the shorts are white, the fabric is heavy/thick enough that it is not see through or anything.  They are great shorts and didn't even get too dirty or discolored after going in the ocean.The only minor problem we had was with the size.  He is a 33 waist, and I debated whether to get him a 32 or 34.  I went with a 34, which fit great when he tried them on.  However, when the shorts get wet and you wear them into the ocean and they stetch out a little, they got too big.  They were better after washing and the fibers tightening back up again, just a little loose.  In hindsight, I would have ordered a 32 waist for him.\",\n",

So I either have to walk with a U-shaped neck or tense my upper body.  On a long walk both options become impossible and I have to remove the bag.  I\\'m going to say that\\'s....ridiculous!!!  The makers of this bag should have seen that coming and either (a) made it adjustable (b) removed the unnecessary strap or (c) not advertised it as a \"Mens Backpack\", because it is not a one-size-fits-all bag - it\\'s just not.  Therefore I give an otherwise good bag only two stars.',\n",

The CoolMax denim fabric not only works wonders in hot weather or during any kind of activity, but it ads some give and stretch to the jeans.  Combined with the diamond gusset crotch and these jeans really move with you.  Incredible comfort not only when you're performing some extreme activity, but also when just sitting on your butt.  The contoured waist band and slightly shorter rise make these jeans sit on your hips where you want them without having the crotch bag down.  This also improves ease of movement and comfort.  And they look nice.  I'm not thrilled with the overly aggressive fade job on the front thighs, but I can live with that.Highly recommended product.\",\n",

When I get off the bike (at a restaurant,etc) I remove the pouch from my bike\\'s trunk bag and snap it around my waist.  The pouch fits and feels good, and will fit a waist size from about 30\" (my waist is 33\") to over 40\".  And the belt adjustment clip stays put (doesn\\'t expand as you wear it).

The straps are padded on the insides with neoprene, the foot bed has some actual support and is a multi-density material that is both softly and firmly cushy and feels velvety smooth on your feet. Most flips I tried were heavy, like a solid block of rubber. But these are light on the feet. And on top of all that they look decent, a nice clean style to them. The only issue I've found is that the smooth foot bed can let your foot slip if you're climbing at an angle on something, but hey, they're flips, not full sandals. This model has been replaced for 2012, which looks to be equivalent. I'll get another pair in a different color. The price is a little high, but its worth it for these babies.\",\n",

This hoodie fits me almost perfectly.  I've had good luck with other Quiksilver products as well.  This particular hoodie is a nice soft lightweight to medium-weight fabric, large hood (most hoods are cut too small to be useful), and nice large front pocket.  I love the army green color, too.  The only complaint I have is the zipper is a little hard to hook up sometimes (I've also had this problem with other Quiksilver tops, actually), but I still would recommend this hoodie to anyone similar to myself in size (tall, not wide).  I think I paid $40 for it, which is more than I'd like but still worth it for a good product.UPDATE: This is still a great sweatshirt, but if you are looking for even more of a slim fit and are willing to hang-dry your hoodies, check out Banana Republic's medium tall men's terry hooded sweatshirt.  OMG.  I have three of these now and I am so glad I found them.  Huge bonus for the BR ones:  NO LOGO!!\",\n",

It\\'s a really nice brown and tan plaid combination.  The left chest pocket has 2 nice details.  First, there is a nice facing along the top of the pocket in which the plaid runs diagonally - a nice contrast to the vertical/horizontal pattern of the rest of the shirt.  Second, the pocket is stitched into 2 compartments:  A long narrow area for a pen/pencil, and a larger pocket area.  There is also a thin edging that runs horizontally on the back of the shirt where the back meets the yoke.  The fabric pattern on this edging also runs diagonally.  There is also a thin \"edging\" detail that runs vertically  up the center of the back yoke to the collar in which the pattern also runs diagonally.  This shirt is 100% cotton, so it needs to be ironed after washing.  It is true to size, but since it is 100% cotton, it might shrink after washing.  The only thing I was disappointed about was the condition 1 shirt arrived in.  As I said, I ordered 2.  One came nicely wrapped around a piece of cardboard and tissue, inside a plastic wrapper with a Quicksilver sticker on it.  The 2nd shirt came in the same plastic wrapper, but it was \"squished\" together and the top button was open.  Upon further inspection, I realized that it did not have the cardboard to keep it in place.  There also was no tissue.  I wonder if someone returned this shirt to Amazon and they just sent it on to me?  It doesn\\'t appear to have been worn, and certainly hasn\\'t been washed, but it did not arrive in the \"newest\" condition.  Still, this shirt is a good price, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member and get free shipping.  It is also stylish and a good brand.',\n",

It seems to be built reasonable well.  He has worn it in the pool with no issues.  It states water resistant to 100m so I am hoping it will last through a summer of much shallower dunkings.The bezel is raised above the glass enough to protect it from most hits/abrasions.  The band seems solidly attached to the watch.  The blue light that illuminates the screen at a button push was a hit.I got him engaged with using the timer to run up/down the hallway and &#34;racing&#34; me and others.  Then he found the countdown timer and started asking us &#34;how long until I get to see my buddy this afternoon?&#34; and setting it for such.  $23 well spent.Downside:  The upper left of the LCD is a graph with days of the week.  The days of the week are not very readable but that is not very important to me/him as he typically knows the day better than I do.  The LCD time area is a bit recessed from the glass and not as clear as you would want for an adult...but he has no problem reading it.',\n",

First thing was that the watch arrived DOA (battery wise).  I had a jeweler put a new battery in the watch and it worked.  Next day was a surf day for me but after about an hour or so in the water the numbers started to slowly turn into Chinese writing.  An hour after that the watch face was blank.  Totally dead.  So, the watch for surfers should not be worn while surfing.  I was not surfing large waves at all.  I did not hit bottom and my watch was not in contact with the board, etc.  I really wanted to like this watch but wow, what a junker.  I'd love to try another one but after that experience, no thanks.  I am not going to put my time of $ into another test.  Happily, I returned it to Amazon where I am sure I will get a refund.\",\n",

If you live east of the rocky's, and west of...I don't know where honestly, Oakley's may be more your style.  If you are a hipster or a millenial, you might be looking for a flat neon frame with lenses that are way too dark.  These aren't for you.I've had 2 pairs of these.  I bought 1 in Hawaii after I sat on my sunglasses.  I paid too much for those and they were still worth it.  Those got stolen, and I bought a second pair off Amazon.  Still may favorite glasses ever, and I've had Persol's, Maui Jim's etc.  These are nice frames with very nice lenses.I've worn these in all conditions including boating, fishing, boarding, and driving.  All around great lenses and they look awesome.  I like that they aren't flat across the top, there is a little bump over the nose.  Separates you from the the guys with the super big, super square frames that the motorcross, wakeboarding, 20 year old set has on.  Also, friends don't let friends wear colored lenses.  Amber lenses have their place for certain environments, but for all around performance and STYLE you must have a gray lens.Quality wise, no complaints at all.  Frame is sturdy, has a nice glossy black finish.  I like these so much that I baby them, always in the bag when not on my head.  Obviously if you throw these around the car, you are going to scratch them.  Mine are still mint after months of use.Very happy with this purchase.  These will be the only glasses I buy as long as they are available.\",\n",

The CoolMax denim fabric not only works wonders in hot weather or during any kind of activity, but it ads some give and stretch to the jeans.  Combined with the diamond gusset crotch and these jeans really move with you.  Incredible comfort not only when you're performing some extreme activity, but also when just sitting on your butt.  The contoured waist band and slightly shorter rise make these jeans sit on your hips where you want them without having the crotch bag down.  This also improves ease of movement and comfort.

The only complaint I have is the zipper is a little hard to hook up sometimes (I've also had this problem with other Quiksilver tops, actually), but I still would recommend this hoodie to anyone similar to myself in size (tall, not wide).  I think I paid $40 for it, which is more than I'd like but still worth it for a good product.UPDATE: This is still a great sweatshirt, but if you are looking for even more of a slim fit and are willing to hang-dry your hoodies, check out Banana Republic's medium tall men's terry hooded sweatshirt.

It\\'s a really nice brown and tan plaid combination.  The left chest pocket has 2 nice details.  First, there is a nice facing along the top of the pocket in which the plaid runs diagonally - a nice contrast to the vertical/horizontal pattern of the rest of the shirt.  Second, the pocket is stitched into 2 compartments:  A long narrow area for a pen/pencil, and a larger pocket area.  There is also a thin edging that runs horizontally on the back of the shirt where the back meets the yoke.  The fabric pattern on this edging also runs diagonally.  There is also a thin \"edging\" detail that runs vertically  up the center of the back yoke to the collar in which the pattern also runs diagonally.  This shirt is 100% cotton, so it needs to be ironed after washing.  It is true to size, but since it is 100% cotton, it might shrink after washing.  The only thing I was disappointed about was the condition 1 shirt arrived in.  As I said, I ordered 2.  One came nicely wrapped around a piece of cardboard and tissue, inside a plastic wrapper with a Quicksilver sticker on it.  The 2nd shirt came in the same plastic wrapper, but it was \"squished\" together and the top button was open.  Upon further inspection, I realized that it did not have the cardboard to keep it in place.  There also was no tissue.  I wonder if someone returned this shirt to Amazon and they just sent it on to me?  It doesn\\'t appear to have been worn, and certainly hasn\\'t been washed, but it did not arrive in the \"newest\" condition.

Next day was a surf day for me but after about an hour or so in the water the numbers started to slowly turn into Chinese writing.  An hour after that the watch face was blank.  Totally dead.

I did not hit bottom and my watch was not in contact with the board, etc.  I really wanted to like this watch but wow, what a junker.

It is premium quality, and has a more athletic cut than the others.  If you are on the lower side of the XL range, these are likely a great fit.

This one too has an insulated front pouch for lunches, etc.  I also like the fact that on the bottom of both is a rubber like material, which will hold up if bag is scuffed on the ground.  I was going to pay $15 or so for a non brand department store one, and noticed a loose thread hanging out and looking closer noticed the zipper unaligned,  and then, along with thin material that didn't look like it would support much weight, etc., felt like I was throwing the money away on junk.

They will not come off when he is walking, which is good because these Croc-style ones he has come off while walking and trips him up.  But, they are very easy to get off so he will take them off or they will fall off when he is rolling around on the floor.  Not a big deal because they are really easy to get back on.  I like the flip-flop style with the strap between the big toe and the other toe, but those make a big red mark between his toes.

              " \"A friend of mine left a pair of similar Quicksilver sandals at my house and I took it upon myself to take them out for a test drive, as my sandals at the time were falling apart. I loved how comfy they were, and how they fit my foot perfectly, so I hopped online and ordered myself a pair. When I told my friend that I ordered them he let me know that I had made a mistake, as the dye in the straps constantly stain his feet black. I decided to give them a shot anyway, as they were a newer and different pair than his, and because my only other pair of sandals were in really bad shape. At first, the sandals didn't do anything to my feet, but that all changed on my first visit to the beach. When I got home I noticed big black spots on my feet that my girlfriend thought were bruises. They were hideous and hard to scrub off. It's been 4 months now and they still dye my feet really bad when they get wet. They will even leave small black marks when I wear them and keep them dry. There are too many comfortable sandals out there that don't stain your skin to waste your money on these. How the other reviewers on Amazon didn't notice this is beyond me... maybe they all live in Nevada. I'm just going to stop being cheap and shell out the $40+ for a nice pair of Rainbows.\",\n",

Others might find these to be of good value, but for me the tightness was problematic. I am giving it four stars for the quality of the sole.',\n",

              " \"This is the fourth pair of these flip flops I've owned now.  Note, it is from repeatedly losing them, never from them breaking.To put it simply, These are my absolute favourite flip flops.  I can't deal with cheap old navy ones, because the plastic strap gives me blisters.  These ones, however, are extremely comfortable, with a cloth strap between the toes.  The part of the strap that actually goes over your feet is suede, and is as comfortable as the rest of the sandal.What's most important to me, however, is the sole of the sandal.  With many high end sandals, you have a firm but, in my opinion, uncomfortable surface.  With these ones however, the sole is made of a foam, so it is extremely comfortable from the beginning, and only gets better as you wear it in.  As I mentioned previously, I've never had any issue with these breaking, and every pair I've had has lasted me until I lost them.The only con that I can think of is that when I had a black pair, the suede would leave a black mark on my foot if they got wet.  However, this only happened a few times, and then that wore out.  It did not affect its comfort or look though.  In conclusion:Pros:+ Most comfortable pair of flip flops I've ever had+ High quality, won't break or wear out on you+ As far as upper end flip flops go, they're pretty cheapCons:- Suede may leave marks on your feet the first few times they get wet.  Only ever had this issue with the black pair though, and I've also owned both brown and tan pairs.Ultimately, I will continue to return to these flip flops each time I need a new pair, as they are comfortable, high quality, and simple but nice looking.\",\n",
              " \"I have bought 2 pairs of these sandals, and am pretty satisfied. They look great and feel great, but wear out rather quickly (the front of my sandals are weathering quickly). They also stain your feet black if you get them wet. I don't have the same problem with the brown pair that I bought. I thought after getting them wet a few times the staining would stop, but unfortunately it never does.For the price and all other things considered, I am happy with the purchase and will buy another pair when my current pair wears out. Ordered the size I wear in tennis shoes and it's a perfect match.\",\n",

As others have stated the strap is quite small and I wasnt sure I'd be able to wear them and that I may have to give them to my wife but I stuck with them and they have stretched out nicely. My only complaint is the overall length. They come exactly to the back of my heal where I normally prefer them to extend a half inch or so past my heal. They are extremely comfortable and I am very pleased with my purchase.\",\n",

These are also not all rubber so they don't weigh a ton like Chacaos, keens, etc, which I also own.-You don't slide on the top of the foam when it gets wet like all other foam sandals bc it has texture.The combination of a little rubber, light/and textured foam, and leather strap makes these things light, durable, and they last over 2 years with wearing them almost everyday. I wore them so much I got more because I was so impressed. I now own 4 pairs in different colors of these. Also the straps never break; and I jump off the boat, walk around in the surf, all kinds of Florida living stuff. Even suction while walking through muddy areas near mangroves in Tampa Bay doesn't break the straps if you forget to take them off before you jump in. Trust a Floridian, these are the best all around. Keen full foot sandals do work better in the mud if you want a mud walking sandal for fishing.I have worn these hiking, traveling around the world, they just hold up.\",\n",

They were very comfortable from the beginning, but did loosen up and become more comfortable after wearing them for a week or two.

The tread of the flip flops has begun to wear on my current (1st pair), but that is after 4 summers of regular use.I used to just buy cheap cloth/leather sandles and would usually get 1/2 way through summer before buying another cheap pair.

The bag looks good but you can tell its a more laid back, younger person's bag as opposed to fine leather brief case, which kinda is the point, hence why it's so inexpensive. The only white on the bag, the quicksilver lettering, isn't too pronounced and doesn't detract from the subtle black  coloring of the bag.In terms of utility, lotta space inside. I carry my work folder, extra papers, a leisure book for the train, mp3 player, bulky headphones, water bottle, relatively large microwaveable glass lunch container, and spare change, pens, note paper, even keys/wallet/phone.My main gripe with the bag is there are no external pockets. It is handy to have at least a water bottle pocket on the side, let alone a small zipper compartment for anything you need quick access to. Alas, you are forced to store everything inside. This leads me to my next point, which is the bag's velcro and snap-buckle fasteners secure the contents of the bag very well. Plenty of different size compartments w/ both zipper and velcro allow you to store your things in a variety of ways and places.Given how light the bag is, how, even when stuffed, it never feels too heavy, the comfy shoulder strap, and low price, this bag is a great buy.\",\n",

The only thing I was disappointed about was the condition 1 shirt arrived in.  As I said, I ordered 2.  One came nicely wrapped around a piece of cardboard and tissue, inside a plastic wrapper with a Quicksilver sticker on it.  The 2nd shirt came in the same plastic wrapper, but it was \"squished\" together and the top button was open.  Upon further inspection, I realized that it did not have the cardboard to keep it in place.  There also was no tissue.  I wonder if someone returned this shirt to Amazon and they just sent it on to me?  It doesn\\'t appear to have been worn, and certainly hasn\\'t been washed, but it did not arrive in the \"newest\" condition.  Still, this shirt is a good price, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member and get free shipping.  It is also stylish and a good brand.',\n",

If you live east of the rocky's, and west of...I don't know where honestly, Oakley's may be more your style.  If you are a hipster or a millenial, you might be looking for a flat neon frame with lenses that are way too dark.  These aren't for you.I've had 2 pairs of these.  I bought 1 in Hawaii after I sat on my sunglasses.  I paid too much for those and they were still worth it.  Those got stolen, and I bought a second pair off Amazon.  Still may favorite glasses ever, and I've had Persol's, Maui Jim's etc.  These are nice frames with very nice lenses.I've worn these in all conditions including boating, fishing, boarding, and driving.  All around great lenses and they look awesome.  I like that they aren't flat across the top, there is a little bump over the nose.  Separates you from the the guys with the super big, super square frames that the motorcross, wakeboarding, 20 year old set has on.  Also, friends don't let friends wear colored lenses.  Amber lenses have their place for certain environments, but for all around performance and STYLE you must have a gray lens.Quality wise, no complaints at all.  Frame is sturdy, has a nice glossy black finish.  I like these so much that I baby them, always in the bag when not on my head.  Obviously if you throw these around the car, you are going to scratch them.  Mine are still mint after months of use.Very happy with this purchase.  These will be the only glasses I buy as long as they are available.\",\n",
